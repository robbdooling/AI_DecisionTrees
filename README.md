AI_DecisionTrees
================

Project 3 for Roxane Canosa's Intelligent Systems class (fall 2013 at RIT): http://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlc/Courses/IS/Projects/20131/Proj3/proj3.html. Canosa's description: "The objective of this project is to create a classifier that learns the structure of data from a set of training examples. The classifier will be in the form of a decision tree that is created from the training examples. The decision tree will then classify unknown test samples and the results of the classification will be reported."
